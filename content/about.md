Welcome to my blog!

My name is Jo√£o Pedro, and I am a 25-year-old engineer from Brazil. I specialize in Embedded Systems, Space, and Robotics, which are fields that have always fascinated me. I have a passion for using my expertise in these areas to problem solve and develop cutting-edge technology that can help solve real-world problems.

My love for science and technology began at a young age, and after being to more than 20 robotics championships I pursued my passion by studying engineering at UFABC. Since then, I have gained extensive experience in developing and implementing complex systems for a variety of applications. From designing electronic products for education to building Brazil's first PocketQube Satellite for space exploration, I have worked on several exciting projects that have allowed me to explore the boundaries of what is possible.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading and watching videos about the latest advancements in my fields of interest and keeping up with the latest trends. Through my blog, I hope to share my experiences, insights, and knowledge with others who share my passion for science, technology and engineering.

Thank you for visiting!
