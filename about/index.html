Since then, I have gained extensive experience in developing and implementing complex systems for a variety of applications. From designing electronic products for education to building Brazil&rsquo;s first PocketQube Satellite for space exploration, I have worked on several exciting projects that have allowed me to explore the boundaries of what is possible.</p><p>In my spare time, I enjoy reading and watching videos about the latest advancements in my fields of interest and keeping up with the latest trends. Through my blog, I hope to share my experiences, insights, and knowledge with others who share my passion for science, technology and engineering.</p><p>Thank you for visiting!</p></div></div></article></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=copyright><span>© 2023 Powered by <a href=http://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></span>
